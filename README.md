# Homework 1: Numerical Experiments

---

## Overview

This repository contains the code for **Homework 1**, which focuses on **numerical experiments**. The core of the assignment is a **Jupyter Notebook** file (`Homework 1.ipynb`), which includes all the code required to reproduce the results. For the experiments to run correctly, you must execute the code cells sequentially. The notebook contains detailed comments to guide you through the process and explain the purpose of each section.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need **Python** and **Jupyter** installed on your system. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to manage project dependencies.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    If you're using Git, you can clone the repository from the command line:
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/HW1.git](https://github.com/your-username/HW 1.git)
    cd HW 1\Code
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    The project includes a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary packages. Run the following command in your terminal to install them:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Code

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

    From the `HW1` directory, start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser.

2.  **Open the notebook:**

    Navigate to and open the `HW1_notebook.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface.

3.  **Execute the cells:**

    Run the code cells **in order** from top to bottom. This ensures that all libraries are imported and that prerequisite functions are defined before they are called. The comments within the notebook provide further details on each step and the purpose of the experiments.
